\section{Security Analysis}

\begin{frame}{Boomerang Attack}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Special Differential Cryptanalysis
    \item two differentials for the two sub ciphers $C_0$ and $C_1$ obtained from cipher $C$ 
    \item $C=C_{0} \circ C_{1}$
    \item shorter differentials have more better probabilities $\implies$ improved results 
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Theorems}
\textbf{Theorem 1:}  Four rounds of Mysterion-128 has at least 45 active S-boxes.  \\
\textbf{Theorem 2:} Four rounds of Mysterion-256 has at least 81 active S-boxes. \\
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Boomerang Attack}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For 128 bit : \\
    We use the Theorem 1  to find the max differential prob that can be obtained : 
    $$\text{Pr}_{diff}(4R) \leq \text{Pr}_{diff}^{max}(Sbox)^{45} = (2^{-2})^{45} = 2^{-90} $$
    $$\implies \text{Pr}_{diff}^{max}(8R) = \text{Pr}_{diff}(4R) *\text{Pr}_{diff}(4R)  = 2^{-90}*2^{-90} = 2^{-180}  
    $$
    the Pr obtained is way less that  brute force probability ($2^{-128}$). \\
    
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Boomerang Attack}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For 256 bit: \\
    We use the Theorem 2  to find the max differential prob that can be obtained : 
    $$\text{Pr}_{diff}^{max}(8R) = \text{Pr}_{diff}(4R) *\text{Pr}_{diff}(4R)  = 2^{-81*2}*2^{-81*2} = 2^{-324} 
    % >> 2^{-256} 
    $$
    the Pr obtained is way less that  brute force probability ($2^{-256}$). \\
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Integral Attack}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integral attacks tries to extract information about the key by observing the sum of ciphertext values.
        \item We may find integral property upto 4 rounds, and then we can mount this attack from 7-9 rounds depending on the key size. 
        \item Sufficient security margin for the full cipher, since there are 12 and 16 rounds for Mysterion -128 and Mysterion-256.
    \end{itemize}
\\\\
\textbf{Division Property - EUROCRYPT 2015}
It allows to construct more efficient integral distinguishers exploiting the limited algebraic degree of reduced ciphers.

\begin{frame}{Invariant subspace Attack}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LS Design models are vulnerable to this attack 
    \item This was identified by performing an exhaustive analysis on a 32 bit block
    \item Addition of Shiftcolumns operation to LS design models (which are called as XLS models) ,this attack can no longer be done 
    \item Shiftcolumns operation prevents the propagation of subspace found for the L-box with high probability
\end{itemize}
